# Restaurant Review App :fork_and_knife:

This repo provides a **demo**  for an app project that was a three person team collaboration  
for a web development course at Northeastern University to build a web app with a  
React, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB stack. This application allows users to search  
for restaurants and to create, view, and update their personalized reviews.
